            <h3>Originality: 4/5</h3>
            <p>Originality is another strength of this novel. The world-building is intricate and unique, and the way that the story is structured is clever and inventive. The idea of the Time Tombs and the Shrike, a mysterious and deadly creature that protects them, is particularly fascinating. While some elements of the novel may be reminiscent of other works of science fiction, Simmons puts his own spin on everything, making Hyperion a fresh and exciting read.</p>
